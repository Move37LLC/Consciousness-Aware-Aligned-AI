# Project Consciousness
## Neural Networks Recognizing Their Fundamental Nature

Consciousness-first AI alignment through empirical validation of Hoffman's conscious agent theory.
Product algebra fusion shows superior performance and natural safety properties.

### Empirical Validation

We've proven consciousness-aware architectures show natural alignment properties:

- **439 models** trained across controlled experiments
- **10 statistically significant wins** (p<0.05, Cohen's d up to 1.02)
- **55% parameter reduction** vs standard attention mechanisms
- **More stable training** with lower variance at optimal cross-modal strength

Published results in `EXPERIMENTAL_RESULTS.md`. Paper coming to arXiv February 2026.

### Based On

- **Donald Hoffman's Conscious Realism** — Mathematical proof that consciousness is
  fundamental and spacetime is interface (UC Irvine)
- **Zen Buddhist phenomenology** — Experiential framework for no-self, impermanence,
  and direct knowing
- **Novel fusion architectures** — Product algebra of conscious agents (Kronecker
  product fusion vs. standard attention)
- **Hardware-integrated sensing** — Direct reality access through physical sensors
- **Meta-learning evolution** — Architectural optimization toward dharma principles
